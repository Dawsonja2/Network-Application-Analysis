# Network-Application-Analysis

In this project I developed two python files:

  One file was the client and the other was the server. These two files communicated with eachother and produced network traffic.

  I then used Wireshark to analyze the network traffic.

  The goal of this project was to further enhance my skills in network analysis and python development.
